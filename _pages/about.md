Hi, I’m a **Ph.D. Student in Economics** at [Université de Montréal](https://sceco.umontreal.ca/).    

My research interests relate to Macroeconomics and Applied Economics. I also focus on relevant policy questions in Public Finance, and socioeconomic issues in Africa, especially in West Africa.

I’m basically a Statistician and Economist, as before joining doctoral program, I graduated from [ENSAE de Dakar](http://ensae.sn/) (Ingénieur Statisticien Economiste - ISE) and before that from [ENSEA d’Abidjan](https://ensea.ed.ci/) (Ingénieur des Travaux Statistiques - ITS). I’ a kind of a ‘old’-‘matheux’ as I’ve done a Bachelor in Mathematics Science at [Université de Lomé](https://www.univ-lome.tg/), in my sweet home country Togo.

You can find more details about me just here, through this [link]() !
